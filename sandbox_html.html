  <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><strong> XYZ Corp.</strong> is happy to present the following proposal to <strong>ABC Inc.</strong> The
    high-level services identified at this time are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Define a software specification for the ABCD Software</li>
    <li>Implement the ABCD Software as per the specification</li>
    <li>Perform QA, performance analysis and testing of the ABCD Software prior to delivery</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The key features of the ABCD Software are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Support both current in-school <strong>PCs</strong> (with IE 8 and later browsers) and
      <strong>iPads.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>A custom <strong>Flash-based multi-media interactive web-application </strong>that will run on modern
      browsers and allow kindergarten students to practice and improve their reading skills. This will use custom
      graphic resources along with <code>animation</code> and <code>audio</code> to provide feedback.
    </li>
    <li>A <strong>HTML5 web-application </strong>that will provide the same functionality as the Flash-based
      web-application but will run on iPads.
    </li>
    <li>A <strong>student tracking and monitoring module</strong> that will keep track of each student's progress
      while using the software. A custom API will be developed so that the above two and also future applications
      will be able to provide statistics to the tracking and monitoring module.
    </li>
    <li>A <strong>classroom management application</strong> that will allow teachers and administrators to manage
      the students, classes and other features of the software.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Technology Specification</h1>
  <p>The following is a list of the features that are being proposed for the ABCD Software.</p>
  <h2>ABCD Software</h2>
  <h3><em>Initial Screens</em></h3>
  <p>These are the initial screens that will be commonly used to access the software:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Student Login Screen:</strong> serves as a welcome screen in which the student selects their name
      from a list of students in the class.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Select Letter Screen:</strong> contains a map or other custom interface to allow the student to
      select a letter to advance to the activities for that letter.
      <ul>
        <li>The current week's letter is highlighted.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Letter Screen: </strong>shown after a letter is selected. The Letter Person appears and an
      associated song is played. The Letter Person greets the child and shares his or her special characteristic.
      <ul>
        <li>This screen also includes some spoken audio, such as instructions, feedback and sounds/words when
          letters/objects are clicked.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Timeline</h2>
